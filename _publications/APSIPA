Radar Cross Section (RCS) target recognition plays
a vital role in radar automatic target recognition (RATR)
systems. As a critical electromagnetic signature, RCS encodes
unique target characteristics include geometric profiles, structural
features, and material properties. However, the complex non-
linear relationship between RCS patterns and target attributes
introduces significant challenges for accurate target identification.
To address this, this paper proposes a hierarchical attention
model for local and global feature integration, named Local-
Global Efficient Channel Attention (LGECA), which enhances
RCS feature representation through modeling both local-specific
interactions and global contextual dependencies. Moreover, an
improved multi-scale convolutional neural network is proposed
as the backbone architecture, leveraging the LGECA module to
establish new state-of-the-art performance in RCS classification.
The comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed module against conventional
approaches.
