Abstract
---
In order to realize fast target recognition and classification based on image, an image classification algorithm combining RI-LBP features and Fast ICA is proposed. Firstly, the texture features of image are calculated with RI-LBP feature operator. Then the Fast-ICA is used to obtain transformation features with low dimension and strong independence. Finally, transformation features are input into the support vector machine (SVM) to train classifier for target classification. The classification experiments of MINST and CIFAR-10 public image sets and FER2013 standard face recognition database shows that, the proposed method has better performance, more feasibility and applicability.
