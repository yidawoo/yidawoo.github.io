Abstract
===
For the problem of target recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, a method of SAR target recognition based on improved convolution neural network (CNN) and data augmentation is proposed. Firstly, Dropout is brought in the training phase to randomly delete some neurons, so that the generalization ability of the network is enhanced. Secondly, L2 regularization is introduced into the network to reduce the structural risk and effectively restrain the over fitting. Then, Adam is used to optimize the network to improve the convergence efficiency of the model. Finally, the preferred rotation data augmentation method is employed for expanding the data set of SAR target. Through the improved network and increased data, the recognition accuracy and generalization of the model are enhanced. Experiments on moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) data set show that the proposed method has higher recognition accuracy and better generalization.
